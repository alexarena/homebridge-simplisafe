# homebridge-simplisafe
homebridge-simplisafe is a plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) that allows you to control your SimpliSafe security system through Homekit. All of this is pretty much one big hack, so it should be approached with a healthy DIY spirit. 

## Installation

- Install Homebridge: `npm install -g homebridge`
- Install homebridge-simplisafe: `npm install -g homebridge-simplisafe`

*Note:* These might require admin permissions to install, which you can get by prepending each command with `sudo`.

## Thanks

Many thanks to [@greencoder](https://github.com/greencoder) for [reverse-engineering the SimpliSafe API](http://www.leftovercode.info/simplisafe.php), [@searls](https://github.com/searls/) for using that to create the [SimpliSafe Node wrapper](https://github.com/searls/simplisafe) and, of course, to [@nfarina](https://github.com/nfarina/) for creating Homebridge.
